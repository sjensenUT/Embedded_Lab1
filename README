This is the code for Lab 1 in EE382N-23 submitted by Steffen Jensen, Jackson
Farley, and Daniel Rauch.

The code is broken up into two main directories:
darknet/ - contains all of the darknet code. It was copied from the original
repo and slightly modified during development
KPN-SystemC/ - contains all of our code, including the provided kahn_process.h

Most of our code can be found in KPN-SystemC/kpn_neuralnet/

array_ops.cpp contains functions used by the fused and unfused tiling solutions,
particularly the merge and scatter layers.

image_data.cpp contains functions for reading and writing float arrays to/from
FIFOs. This is what the layers use to communicate images to each other.

kpn_neuralnet.cpp contains the bulk of our application's code. It defines the
class methods for the image reader/writer, and three layer types that are 
essentially SystemC wrappers around darknet's layer structs. It also implements
the sc_main method that instantiates each layer with their necessary parameters
and connects them together using sc_fifos.

kpn_neuralnet_fused.cpp implements a fused layer path for a single tile used in
the fused-tile partitioning part of the lab.

merge_scatter.cpp implements merge and scatter layers that are used between
each layer in the unfused tiled approach and at the beginning and end of the 
fused tile approach.

To run our solution, run "make" and "make test" in KPN-SystemC/kpn_neuralnet.
